<h2 style="text-align: center;">LinkWrangler
</h2>
<p>This Addon will allow you to open multiple&nbsp;link reference
windows&nbsp;from text links in the chat window. Ever been asked to
compare items
from the chat window for someone? Sitting there clicking back and forth
between the two links, trying to remember the statistics of each? Ever
want to look at multiple items as they blaze by you in the chat frame
only to find out that the other links have long since disappeared by
the time you are done with the first? This is the addon for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on item, spell and other types of link in chat will bring
up multiple&nbsp;reference windows for side-by-side comparison or just
for simultaneous
browsing</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compatible Addons can add extra information to the reference
windows in the same way as the standard tooltip. &nbsp;AddOn developers
can find instructions in <a href="Developer.htm">Developer.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adds extra buttons to the reference window:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Close : Closes the window. You can&nbsp;Shift-click any LinkWrangler Close button to close <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> LinkWranger windows</li>
<li>Minimize : Temporarily reduces the window to a narrow bar. Click the Minimize button again to return it to normal size.</li>
<li>Compare : Opens comparison windows for any items you have equipped, that use the same inventory slot as the linked item</li>
<li>Relink : Opens the Chat Promt and/or inserts the link at the cursor position</li>
<li>Whisper : Opens the Chat Prompt ready to send a Whisper (Tell) to the person that posted the link</li>
<li>Dress-up : If it is equippable, the linked item will be displayed on the dress-up model</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Various <a href="SlashCommands.htm">configuration commands</a>, to enable/disable some features of LinkWrangler for personal preference, or to ease compatability with other Addons</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Key Bindings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Capture: Open a new LinkWrangler window from the item currently
under the
mouse pointer. Works from bags, inventory, or most other places that
create a standard Game Tooltip on mouseover (the link information is
captured from the tooltip, so you must wait for the tooltip to show
before using the keybind)</li><li>Close all windows: close all open LinkWrangler windows (pressing the ESC key also closes all LinkWranger windows)</li><li>Minimize All Windows: Minimizes any open windows <span style="font-style: italic;">unless</span> all windows are already minimized, in which case they are all maximized.</li><li>Enable
or Disable: Toggle enable/disable LinkWrangler, in case it conflicts
with another mod. However in many cases it should be possible to
configure LinkWrangler so that it does not conflict.</li>
</ul>
